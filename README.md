## Hi there 👋
My name is Khushi Desai, and I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago, pursuing my MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy. I am currently working as a Data Visualization fellow at the [Centre for Digital Scholarship](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/research/scholar/), [Regenstein Library](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/spaces/joseph-regenstein-library/), [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en). 
I graduated from [St. Xavier's College, Mumbai](https://xaviers.ac/) before joining UChicago. I am also affiliated to [The Center for Climate, Health, and Society (CHAS)](https://chas.uchicago.edu/) at The University of Chicago Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, and [Knowledge Lab](https://knowledgelab.org/) at the University of Chicago.


_We used to think that if we knew one, we knew two, because one and one are two. We are finding that we must learn a great deal more about "and"._
