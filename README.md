## Hi there 👋
My name is Khushi Desai, and I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago, pursuing my [MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/). I am currently working as a Data Visualization fellow at the [Centre for Digital Scholarship](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/research/scholar/), [Regenstein Library](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/spaces/joseph-regenstein-library/), [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en). 


I graduated from [St. Xavier's College, Mumbai](https://xaviers.ac/) before joining UChicago. I am also affiliated to [The Center for Climate, Health, and Society (CHAS)](https://chas.uchicago.edu/) at The University of Chicago Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, and [Knowledge Lab](https://knowledgelab.org/) at the University of Chicago. I have also had the privilege to work with a wonderful mentor on some really cool stuff at [Political Economy and Race (PEARL)](https://www.patriciaposey.com/pearl) for over a year. From writing code which was good, bad and ugly, to developing beautiful, accessible visualisations, and working with messy data, PEARL is where I grew up, one mistake at a time.

Thanks to some cool folks at UChi, I teach data visualisation workshops every quarter, at my favourite building on campus, the Reg. Check them out:
1. [Data Art](https://events.uchicago.edu/event/254638-r-and-ggplot2-workshop) in R using `ggplot2`
2. [Spatial Data visualisation](https://events.uchicago.edu/event/257015-introduction-to-ggmap-visualizing-spatial-data) in R using `ggmaps` 

I like to occassionally ramble coherently on art, history, feminism, math, and all things code. If any of these topics interest you, come say [Hi!](mailto:khushi@uchicago.edu)
